# Freydom
========================

This module allows recovery of vocal content of the Frey Effect, also known as the microwave auditory effect. It is
named after Allen Frey, who first researched the microwave auditory effect and published his findings.

The module is meant to give targeted individuals who experience the microwave auditory effect a means to collect
actionable evidence.

Procedure for recovering vocal content from the microwave auditory effect:

### Step 1: Recording audio
1. Use a portable recording device. The easiest choice is a smartphone with a voice recording application.
2. Point the recording device's microphone towards your right collar-bone and press it against your body gently and
   press record.
3. Keep recording while you hear the microwave auditory effect until you are satisfied that you have recorded enough
   material.

### Step 2. Processing audio
